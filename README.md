# Fall.2022.RAD.workshop

This repository will hold code and general information for how to analyze a RADseq dataset on the KU high performance computing cluster. Each week we will meet and work together to progress through the pipeline, starting the semester with raw sequence data and hopefully ending with population genetic analyses and exciting new knowledge about the evolutionary history of some of our favorite organisms.

## Semester Schedule
> You can access the detailed information you will need to follow along with your own dataset each week by clicking on the header for the given week.

### [Week 1](https://github.com/DevonDeRaad/Fall.2022.RAD.workshop/tree/main/week1):
> Introduction to the command-line, plus instructions on moving your raw sequence data onto the KU cluster.

### [Week 2](https://github.com/DevonDeRaad/Fall.2022.RAD.workshop/tree/main/week2):
> Demultiplexing our raw sequence data into a separate .fastq.gz file for each individual sample, and submitting our first jobs to the KUHPCC slurm manager.

### [Week 3](https://github.com/DevonDeRaad/Fall.2022.RAD.workshop/tree/main/week3):
> Using the R package (fastqcR)[https://github.com/kassambara/fastqcr] to assess the quality and amount of sequence data in each sample and immediately remove samples that have very low numbers of raw reads, i.e., (bad apples)[https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13562].

### [Week 4](https://github.com/DevonDeRaad/Fall.2022.RAD.workshop/tree/main/week4):
> We will run through the entire (Stacks)[https://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/] pipeline with default parameters to generate a preliminary SNP dataset.

### [Week 5](https://github.com/DevonDeRaad/Fall.2022.RAD.workshop/tree/main/week5):
> Perform preliminary pop-gen analyses like making a phylogenetic network and a PCA, to make sure that you don't have issues with duplicate samples, contamination, bar-coding, etc.

### [Week 6](https://github.com/DevonDeRaad/Fall.2022.RAD.workshop/tree/main/week6):
> Use the set of samples that you are relatively confident in based on
