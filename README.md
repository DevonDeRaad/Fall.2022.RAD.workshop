# Fall.2022.RAD.workshop

This repository will hold code and general information for how to analyze a RADseq dataset on the KU high performance computing cluster. Each week we will meet and work together to progress through the pipeline, starting the semester with raw sequence data and hopefully ending with population genetic analyses and exciting new knowledge about the evolutionary history of some of our favorite organisms. Please check the directory for each week to follow along with your own dataset.
